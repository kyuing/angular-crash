The Future of Protractor

The Angular team has been working with the community to determine the future of Protractor. We’re currently reviewing the feedback shared in the RFC. We’re still figuring out the best future for Protractor. <b>We’ve opted to not include it in new projects and, instead, provide options with popular 3rd party solutions in the Angular CLI.</b> We are currently working with Cypress, WebdriverIO, and TestCafe to help users adopt the alternative solutions. More information to come as this develops.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
